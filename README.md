## Problem Statement:
Women in rural areas are unaware of the various opportunities already open for them. They often lack the skills required to be working in jobs. They also face oppression from their families.

## Solution:
We have come up with a platform where empowered/educated women can share their vast knowledge and skills with the less fortunate, allowing women to empower women.

## Technology Used:
Django(framework), Python(backend), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap(frontend)
